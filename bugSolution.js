To resolve incompatibility issues, consider the following approaches:

1. **Use Expo-compatible alternatives:** Explore the Expo ecosystem for alternative packages designed to work seamlessly with the managed workflow.  Many packages have Expo-specific versions or alternatives that eliminate compatibility problems.  For `react-native-video`, investigate Expo's video player API or other compatible video players. For background tasks explore Expo's TaskManager API.

2. **Eject from Expo:** If compatibility is crucial and alternatives are unavailable or insufficient, consider ejecting your project from Expo's managed workflow. This converts your project into a bare React Native project, granting full control over package integration, but involves significant configuration changes and potentially increased maintenance responsibilities.

3. **Conditional Loading:** Implement conditional loading to only load incompatible packages when the application is not running in Expo Go.  This requires checking if the application is running in the Expo Go environment and loading the package accordingly. 

4. **Custom Native Modules (Advanced):**  If you have expertise in native iOS/Android development, building a custom native module to bridge the functionality of the incompatible package could provide a solution.  However, this is a considerably more advanced approach.

The `bugSolution.js` file might demonstrate one or more of these solutions, depending on the specific bug.
