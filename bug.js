This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that uses a package that is not compatible with the Expo managed workflow. This is because Expo CLI uses a different build system than a bare React Native project, and some packages are not compatible with this system. One common example is react-native-video which may result in the following error:  "Invariant Violation: requireNativeComponent: "RCTVideo" was not found in the UIManager". Another example is react-native-background-timer, where if you're using Expo Go, the `start` method of the background timer might not work reliably, leading to the timer not executing in the background.
